[https://iac-basics.firebaseapp.com]

## Getting Started
1) Clone or download the repo.
2) Open a terminal at the root (or run `cd basics`).
3) Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4) Rename `environments[EDIT AND RENAME]` to `environments`, and add your Firebase keys (as per the tutorial(s)).
4) Run `ionic s`.

## Possible Next Steps
* Play around with the code - rewrite some functions in order to better understand what they do; break stuff and fix it!
* Run the app on different devices - access the live dev server (typically localhost:8100) on your phone/tablet by connecting to the same Wi-Fi network and typing the localhost address in the browser address bar.
* Simulate different devices using your browsers Developer Tools (easy to do; search google for instructions for your particular browser).
* Rebuild the FAQ Page.
* Write your own **lifecycle** events using Angular's `DoCheck` (https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks#docheck).
